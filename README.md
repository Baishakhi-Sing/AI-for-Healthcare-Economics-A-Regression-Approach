This project applies **machine learning and data science techniques** to predict **healthcare expenses** based on demographic and lifestyle factors such as **age, BMI, smoking habits, children, and region**.  

Using a **synthetic healthcare dataset**, the workflow demonstrates:
- ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â†’ uncovering insights and trends in patient demographics.  
- ðŸ›  **Data Preprocessing** â†’ encoding categorical features and scaling numerical ones.  
- ðŸ¤– **Predictive Modeling** â†’ applying **Linear Regression** to estimate healthcare costs.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Evaluation** â†’ analyzing results with **MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score**.  

This project showcases how **data-driven methods** can be leveraged in the healthcare sector to estimate costs, support decision-making, and highlight the impact of factors like **smoking and BMI** on expenses.  
It is designed as a **beginner-to-intermediate machine learning project**, serving as a solid foundation for predictive analytics in healthcare economics.
